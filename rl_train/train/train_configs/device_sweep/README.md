# Device sweep — imitation training, one config per bilateral exo

Eight configs, one per bilateral powered device. They differ only in `device_key` and in the joint
the exo sub-policy observes, so any difference in outcome is attributable to the device.

## Train

```bash
python rl_train/run_train.py \
  --config_file_path rl_train/train/train_configs/device_sweep/imitation_22_Tutorial_L1_h128_e32_sidenet_mirror0p1_actpen10.json \
  --config.total_timesteps 30000000 \
  --config.env_params.num_envs 32
```

## Evaluate

```bash
python -m rl_train.run_policy_eval rl_train/results/<train_session_...> --no-show --steps 1000 --regen
python tools/score_exo_policy.py     rl_train/results/<train_session_...>/analyze_results_00
python tools/plot_kinematics_exo.py  rl_train/results/<train_session_...>/analyze_results_00 -o out.png
```

Use `--steps 1000` (~30 strides). The 200-step default is ~5 strides, too few for a per-phase
quantity such as when in the cycle the exo peaks.

## Regenerate the configs

They are generated, not hand-written:

```bash
python tools/make_device_sweep_configs.py --exo-shared-side-net --mirror-coef 0.1 \
  --human-net 128 --exo-net 32 --muscle-activation-penalty 10
```

`--out-dir` writes elsewhere. `python tools/make_device_sweep_configs.py --help` lists the other
options.

## The eight devices

| device | transmission | assisted joint | exo obs (qpos / qvel) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Tutorial_L1` | joint | ankle | `[0,2]` / `[8,10]` |
| `DephyExoBoot_L1` | joint | ankle | `[0,2]` / `[8,10]` |
| `Humotech_L1` | joint | ankle | `[0,2]` / `[8,10]` |
| `OpenExo_L1` | joint | ankle | `[0,2]` / `[8,10]` |
| `STRIDE_L2` | tendon + linkage | ankle | `[0,2]` / `[8,10]` |
| `UTAnkleExo_L2` | tendon + linkage | ankle | `[0,2]` / `[8,10]` |
| `Hippo_L1` | joint | **hip** | `[2,4]` / `[10,12]` |
| `HMEDI_L1` | tendon | **hip** | `[2,4]` / `[10,12]` |

`python -m assist_sim list` offers 13 devices for `myolegs22`. The other five are a different
class: `Anatomics_L1` has no device actuator on an intact model, and `KFoot_L1`, `NEUankle_L1`,
`OpenSourceLeg_A_L1` and `OpenSourceLeg_KA_L1` are prostheses — the device performs an amputation,
so the muscle set is truncated, the action layout differs per device, and there is no mirror map.
Those four have their own configs and generator: see [`prosthesis/`](../prosthesis/README.md).

## The config

* **Weight-shared per-side exo network** (`exo_actor_r` / `exo_actor_l`) — one network applied to
  each leg with that leg's own inputs first, so `Exo_L(s) = Exo_R(mirror(s))` holds by construction.
  The `NET` arm of Abdolhosseini et al. 2019, *On Learning Symmetric Locomotion*.
* **`mirror_coef 0.1`** — Yu et al. 2018 mirror penalty on the policy (`rl_train/train/mirror_ppo.py`).
* **`muscle_activation_penalty 10`**, squared, and no device cost.

Rank candidates with `tools/score_exo_policy.py`, not with `mirror_loss`: a policy can lower the
mirror loss by driving both exo outputs toward zero.
