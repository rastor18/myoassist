"""Every shipped prosthesis config builds an amputee env, keeps its layout, and trains a step.

The amputee configs are the ones a layout change breaks silently. The device performs the
amputation, so the muscle count, the observation length and the joint and sensor names all
differ per device and none of them match the intact 22-muscle configs the rest of the suite
covers. A config addresses observations by absolute index, so a device model that gains or
loses a muscle repoints every sub-policy without raising.
