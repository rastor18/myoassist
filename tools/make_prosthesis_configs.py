"""Generate one imitation-training config per prosthetic device.

The exo sweep (`tools/make_device_sweep_configs.py`) covers the bilateral drop-in devices:
an intact 22-muscle model, two device actuators, and a left/right mirror pair. The
prostheses are the other class, and its own generator, because every assumption that sweep
rests on is false here:

  * **The human model is asymmetric.** The device performs the amputation, so the composed
    model is missing muscles, joints and sensors on the prosthetic side. `myolegs22 +
    OpenSourceLeg_A_L1` has 18 muscles, not 22, and no `ankle_angle_r` or `mtp_angle_r`.
    Every absolute observation index in an exo config is therefore wrong here, and the
    counts differ per device, so the layout has to be read off the composed model.
  * **There is no mirror map.** `mirror.py:_swap_name` requires every actuator to have a
    partner on the other side; on an amputee model it raises, correctly. `mirror_coef` is
    pinned to 0 and the per-side shared exo network (`exo_actor_r`/`exo_actor_l`) is not
    used -- a single `exo_actor` drives the one-sided device.
  * **The reference is a healthy walker.** `short_reference_gait.npz` has `q_ankle_angle_r`,
    but the model it would be written to has no such joint, and more fundamentally the whole
    amputated side cannot reach a healthy, near-symmetric trajectory: without an ankle
    push-off the residual limb's knee does not produce the healthy swing-phase flexion. The
    qpos/qvel imitation weights therefore keep only the pelvis and the intact leg. Because
    `MyoAssistLegImitation.step` reads that same dict for its `out_of_trajectory_threshold`
    check, this also stops the affected side from terminating episodes; the threshold itself
    is relaxed from the intact configs' 0.2 because the intact leg compensates and does not
    track a healthy walker as tightly either. `reference_data_keys` still *places* the
    residual limb from the reference at reset -- dropping a joint from the reward is not the
    same as starting it from an arbitrary pose.

    This is measured, not assumed. On the first 30M runs (imitation on the affected side,
    threshold 0.2) `knee_angle_r` was both the largest tracking error and the most frequent
    cause of termination, and both prosthesis runs stopped improving at ~15M steps -- episode
    length 4.1 -> 4.7 for `OpenSourceLeg_A_L1` -- while the intact `Tutorial_L1` control,
    sharing all of this infrastructure, kept improving to the end (4.25 -> 7.51) and walked
    39 m in evaluation against the prostheses' 1 m.

Devices, all right-sided (`python -m assist_sim list` for the registry):

    OpenSourceLeg_A_L1    transtibial, powered ankle          18 muscle + 1 motor
    NEUankle_L1           transtibial, powered ankle          18 muscle + 1 motor
    OpenSourceLeg_KA_L1   transfemoral, powered knee+ankle    15 muscle + 2 motor
    KFoot_L1              transtibial, passive spring foot    18 muscle + 0 motor

`KFoot_L1` has no motor, so there is nothing for an exo sub-policy to drive and
`EnvironmentHandler._validate_action_layout` rejects the exo policy for it. Its config uses
`myoAssistLegImitation-v0` and the muscle-only `HumanActorCriticPolicy`, which reads the whole
observation and writes the whole action, so it carries no `net_indexing_info`.

Nothing about the layout is tabulated here: the muscle count, the actuator names, the
prosthetic joints that stand in for the missing human ones, and the joint-limit sensors that
survive the amputation are all read from the composed model, so a device or model change
cannot leave a stale index behind.
